<u><strong>Samsung account U.S. Privacy Notice</strong></u>
</center>
<br>
<br>
Effective [July 4, 2023]<br>
<br>
Samsung Electronics Co., Ltd., along with our affiliates and subsidiaries (collectively, “Samsung”), respects your concerns about privacy. This Samsung account U.S. Privacy Notice applies to the personal information we obtain through your Samsung account and its services and features (collectively, “Services”). It does not apply to information collected by other apps, websites or services provided by Samsung.<br>
<br>
This Privacy Notice supplements the Samsung Privacy Policy for the U.S. (available at <a href="https://account.samsung.com/membership/terms/privacypolicy" target="_blank">https://account.samsung.com/membership/terms/privacypolicy</a>) (“Samsung US Privacy Policy”) and provides additional information about how we may collect, use, and share your personal information in connection with our Services. In the event that any portion of this Privacy Notice conflicts with the Samsung US Privacy Policy, the relevant provisions of this Privacy Notice will govern.<br>
<br>
<br>
<u><strong>Information We Obtain</strong></u><br>
<br>
Samsung account is your one-stop account to enjoy some of our Samsung services and features. When you first create a Samsung account, we may collect information such as your name, nickname, date of birth, gender, phone number, password and email address.<br>
<br>
Once you set up your Samsung account and log in, you can use convenient features on your Samsung devices. When you use your Samsung account, we may collect and maintain information about you in various ways. The types of personal information we may obtain include those listed in the Samsung US Privacy Policy as well as the following:<br>
<br>
<br>
<u>Information You Provide Directly</u><br>
<br>
You may have the option to save information to your Samsung account, such as :<br>
<br>
• When you register your credit card to your Samsung account for easier payment options or when you save information such as your address for faster checkout when you make purchases on your Samsung mobile device, Smart TV or Samsung websites. We encrypt sensitive information (like your credit card details) for enhanced security; and<br>
• When you save your personal information (e.g., name, phone number, email, mailing or shipping address) to fill in and use for participating Samsung or third party apps, websites, or services. You can back up user IDs & passwords to log in quickly using biometric authentication. Such biometric information is stored only on your device, and Samsung does not collect or have access to this information.<br>
<br>
You also may provide us information when you register a product through our product registration process.<br>
<br>
In addition, when you contact customer service about the Services, your communications, including any information you provide regarding your identity and product or service you’re contacting us about, may be collected.<br>
<br>
<br>
<u>Information We Collect While Using Specific Services</u><br>
<br>
With your Samsung account, certain services and features become available. For example, you can back up your data and restore it anytime, or synchronize your data between your Samsung devices, share your profile and files with others, and find your device when it’s lost. For these services and features to work, we need to collect certain information, including the following :<br>
<br>
• <strong>Sync and back-up</strong> : Some features allow you to sync, back up and restore your data on Samsung mobile devices and Smart TVs. For example, you can back up or sync certain data to our cloud service. The data you choose to back up or sync will automatically be sent to and stored by Samsung. For Gallery sync, this feature is offered through Microsoft OneDrive. If you turn on syncing on one device where you are logged into your Samsung account, sync will automatically turn on in your other devices where you have logged into your Samsung account. You can manage your sync preferences in the Samsung account settings in any of your devices.<br>
• <strong>Call & Text</strong> : If you enable Call & text on other devices, we may collect information such as contacts, messages, and message and call logs so you can experience multi-device communication. To properly sync calls to your secondary device, we may momentarily access your calls to relay them to your secondary device in real time. We do not maintain a copy of these calls.<br>
• <strong>Membership benefits</strong> : Your Samsung account makes coupons, discounts and gift cards available to you, and you can earn rewards points when purchasing Samsung products and services. We collect information regarding these coupons, discounts, gift card and your reward points, and how and where you spend or redeem them.<br>
• <strong>Social Media</strong> : You can connect and interact with other Samsung account users on our social media platforms, such as Samsung Members Community. We may collect content you provide through or on the Community, such as your profile information, posts and comments (including media you upload) and information on the products you register (including warranty information), as well as communication (including information you submit) with our customer team and other Community members (including the content of personal messages).<br>
• <strong>Group Sharing</strong> :<br>
o Group Sharing allows you to easily share files and other information, such as notes, reminders, calendar entries, gallery photos, and your and your contacts’ phone numbers and profile information with other Samsung account users, and allows you to display profile images of your contacts within your contacts list and when you receive calls.<br>
o When you create or join a group and share notes, reminders, calendar entries, or gallery photos, all content and files you share will be visible to all other members of the group. The group leader will always have permission to delete or edit entries submitted by anyone in the group. If you are not the group leader, you can delete or edit shared reminder, calendar, and gallery entries at any time while you are a member of the group. Other members will also be able to delete or edit your shared entries. For shared note entries, while you are a member of the group, you may only delete or edit entries (including entries you submit) if the group leader grants you permission. Other members will also be able to edit or delete your shared note entries after receiving permission from the group leader.<br>
o We may collect the contents and information you share with the group, as well as your and your contacts’ phone numbers and profile information.<br>
o If you leave or are removed from a group, all of your shared entries that you have not deleted will remain in the group for other members to see and edit. If you later wish to access or delete those entries, you would need to re-join the group and obtain any needed permissions from the group leader. Once you are no longer a member of a group, we will not be able to associate you with any of your shared entries or grant you access to those entries.<br>
• <strong>Quick Share</strong> : The Quick Share feature, available on certain Galaxy devices, enables you to quickly share photos, videos, and files. Quick Share can be used to share content between Galaxy devices in close proximity to each other via the device-to-device method. Quick Share can also be used to share content by sending a link that can be used to access the shared content using any internet-connected device. When using this method, we may collect the content you share, which will remain available for 3 days before it is automatically deleted. You can also add extra protection such as file encryption, setting an expiration date and revoking access to the files by using the private sharing option, which will delete the content you share immediately after the recipient receives it.<br>
• <strong>Security</strong> : Your Samsung account offers several security features, including SmartThings Find and Secure Wi-Fi. If you choose to use these features, we may collect information such as your device’s physical location, recent calls and text messages, touch interactions, your device’s PIN, password or pattern, subscription details and Digital Key details.<br>
The use of certain features may require you to register for other Samsung services. For example, to use SmartThings Find through SmartThings, you may be required to register for SmartThings. For more information about how SmartThings processes your information, please review the SmartThings <a href="https://www.smartthings.com/privacypolicy" target="_blank">Privacy Notice</a>.<br>
• <strong>Account and service linking</strong> : Certain third party apps or services may allow you to link your Samsung account to that third party’s account for easy log in and to access enhanced features. Note that such third-party websites, apps, services, and features may operate independently from Samsung and may have their own privacy notices or policies, which you should review to understand how they process your information.<br>
• <strong>Device and Service Information</strong> :<br>
i. <u>Hardware information</u> : such as model, device name, device configuration and settings, connected devices, sales code, MCC (mobile country code); MNC (mobile network code) and when your device was first used or purchased;<br>
ii. <u>Software information</u> : such as version and configuration, and operating system version; and<br>
iii. <u>Identifiers</u> : such as IMEI, IP address, serial number, MAC address and other unique device or service identifiers (such as Android ID, Smart TV identifiers, variable unique device ID, and service ID).<br>
• <strong>Log and Usage Information</strong> : Diagnostic, technical, error, and usage information such as time and duration of your use of the Services, traffic usage, and touch interaction.<br>
• <strong>Other information</strong> about your use of your Samsung account, such as the features and services you use, purchase history and subscriptions, and how you interact with content offered through your Samsung account.<br>
<br>
We may collect personal information about your online activities on websites and connected devices over time and across third-party websites, devices, apps and other online features and services. We may use third-party analytics services, such as Google Analytics and Firebase Analytics. The information we obtain may be disclosed to or collected directly by these providers and other relevant third parties who use the information, for example, to evaluate use of the Services and to help improve the Services.
